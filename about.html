      <h2>Fran’s Story</h2>
      <p>Francine Miller opened Fran’s Flowers in 1995 with a simple idea: bring color and kindness into people’s everyday lives. She started out arranging bouquets for neighbors in the Mission District, and her passion for flowers quickly became a neighborhood tradition.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Fran’s shop has become a community hub, supporting local growers and donating a portion of sales to fight homelessness in San Francisco. Her dedication has earned her loyal customers across the Bay Area.</p>
